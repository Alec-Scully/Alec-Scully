### ðŸ’«  Hello! Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹


My name is Alec Scully (he/him) and I am a full-stack software engineer. I am originally from Media, Pennsylvania, but moved down to Chester, Maryland in late 2019. I have a BS in Computer Science from West Chester University, and just recently graduated from the Flatiron School's software development bootcamp in March 2021.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... React Hooks followed by Redux.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... Refactoring old projects from Flatiron!
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I have been a memeber of multiple different marching arts groups, including the Crossmen Drum and Bugle Corps from San Antonio, Texas! I loved talking about my experiences in the marching arts, so don't hesitate to ask if you are curious!
